        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage; it is a container for metadata.</li>
          <li>Inside head elements, metadata tags can also be used.</li>
          <li>The title metadata tag defines the title of the webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines CSS styles associated with the webpage.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for the webpage.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as: the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body of an HTML document contains child and parent elements.</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements nested inside of other elements.</li>
          <li>The parent element holds all the child elements.</li>
          <li>Remember: not all elements are semantic.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements have names that describe their content, and the role they play on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The heading element represents the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>Order matters when using heading elements and the biggest heading should only appear once on the page.</li>
          <li>The paragraph element represents paragraphs, or blocks of text.</li>
          <li>The list elements including: unordered lists, ordered lists, list items, are used to create lists on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The image element contains information about images displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The break element creates a line of empty space between two blocks of content on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The anchor element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The section element defines a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes define additional information about an element.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>The CSS box model dictates that every HTML element is essentially a box with margins.</li>
          <li>In CSS a wild card symbol * can be used to apply a specific rule to all of the elements visible on a page.</li>
          <li>Heading text can be styled to be centered on a webpage using the rule property "text-align".</li>
          <li>The img selector can also be used to apply CSS styling rules to images.</li>
          <li>A CSS rule must contain a selector, and declaration. The declaration must contain both a property and a value.</li>
          <li>Within CSS, a selector is the element or attributes that rules (declarations) will apply to.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: 1) the CSS property that we want to apply, 2) the value of said property.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
            <li>git revert SHA: reverts back to the version of code that is related to the SHA</li>
            <li>git add -A: adds all modifications in the current working branch to the staging area</li>
            <li>git commit -m "[description]": commits the staged changes to repo</li>
            <li>git pull: pulls information from the tracking remote branch and merges it</li>
            <li>git push: pushes local branch information to the remote repo branch</li>
          </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>JS is case-sensitive, syntax and capitalization matters.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A string is a sequence of text that is enclosed in single or double quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Number values do not need quotation marks.</li>
          <li>A Boolean is a true/false value.</li>
          <li>An array is a structure that allows us to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li>Everything in JS is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code, which are ignored by the web browser.</li>
          <li>Operators are mathematical symbols that produce a result based on 2 variables, or values.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures that are used to test if an expression returns true or not.</li>
          <li>If...else statements are the most common form of conditionals.</li>
          <li>In JS the order of the code affects the outcome, because control flow dictates that files will be executed from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops can be used to interupt control flow, and change the order in which code is executed.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable used to hold a group of data, and a single array can store multiple different types of data.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predicatable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains three important statements: a keyword, a three-part conditional statement, and a code block.</li>
          <li>Functions are a set of instructions that tell the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute when a JS file is run; they must be called in the code at the spot where developers want the function to execute.</li>
